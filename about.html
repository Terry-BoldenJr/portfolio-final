<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Terry Bolden Jr and I am a web develooper. I took up the craft aboout two years ago and I haven't stopped learning since. 
I started my journey at Merit Anmerica where I excelled at the one thing I have been good at it my entire life; problem solving.
With the help of my coach and the tremendous amount of support I got from Merit America, I passed the bootcamp with high aspirations.</p>

<p>After bootcamp, upon my search for Mentors, I met the most amazing helpful support that one could ever have. Maigen Thosmas was running 
a workshop for Website Accessibility. Here is where I learned to alwaya prepare my designs for the most of everyday users, including those with disabilities. 
This workshop helpeed to build my confidence and now I am confident that my designs will not only be user friendly, but also accessible to as many people
as possible.</p>

<p>My desire in this world is to build applications and websites that will thrill users and solve problems for my clients.I want them
to enjoy The Bolden Design Experience</p>
