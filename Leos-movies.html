<h3>Grease</h3>

<p>
	The Ultimate "Boy Meets Girl, Boy loses girl, Boy gets girl back again Movies.

</p>
<h3>Star Wars: "A New Hope" </h3>

<p>
	Release my birth year, pretty sure watched this ALOT as a baby, because it is up there as one of my all time joys.

<h3>Top Gun</h3>

<p> One of the true treats of Tom Cruise's career. It is just something about the music that transcends the film
	even though I am not a huge Tom Cruise Fan.
